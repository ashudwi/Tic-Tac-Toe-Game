# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

In this project, I made a simple Tic-Tac-Toe Game using [React](https://reactjs.org) library of JavaScript. In this Game, I do have implemented the feature of Winner and Game-Draw. In either of these two cases, you can use the restart button to restart the Game.

## Requirements and Execution

If you're using Linux-based OS, open your terminal, and clone the app using the following command. <br>
`git clone https://github.com/yogendra3236/Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.git`
<br><br>
Or, create a new react app by writing the following command <br>
`npx create-react-app tic-tac-toe`

Next, get into the project-directory, and type the following command to install necessary dependencies onto your system. <br>
`sudo npm install` 
<br>

Now, you're all set. Just write `npm start` to start your local server. <br>
Open your browser, and go to http://localhost:3000/ to play the game. <br><br>
Happy Coding:)
